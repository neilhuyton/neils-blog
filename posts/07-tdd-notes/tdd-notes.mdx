#### Type Annotations

Lightweight ways to record the intended contract of the function or variable.

#### Interfaces

Describes objects

#### Classes

Classes in TypeScript are just a shorthand for the same prototype-based OO that is frequently used in JavaScript.

#### Basic Types

Boolean: true/false
Number: floating point values
String: textual data, uses double quotes (") or single quotes (') to surround string data
Array:
first, you use the type of the elements followed by []
second way uses a generic array type

#### Tuple

Express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but need not be the same
let x: [string, number];

#### Enum

An enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values
enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
let c: Color = Color.Green;

#### Any

Opt-out of type checking

#### Void

Little like the opposite of any e.g. return type of functions that do not return a value

#### Null and Undefined

#### Never

Represents the type of values that never occur e.g. return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns

#### Object

A type that represents the non-primitive type e.g. object, array

#### Type assertions

Type assertions are a way to tell the compiler “trust me, I know what I’m doing.”

`let x: [string, number];`
